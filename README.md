# Exercise - Writing Functions & Tests

**For this exercise I wrote the bare-bones functionality for a calculator along with some tests to verify that things are behaving the way they should.**

## Before I Started...

- Pulled the start point from GitHub and copied it to my coursework directory
- Initialised my own Git repository in the **copied** folder
- Installed the dependencies using `npm install`

## Task

The start point contained two files for me to edit: `calculator.js` and `calculator.test.js`. There was also a `package.json` file listing the dependencies with the testing scripts already defined.

In `calculator.js`:

- Defined the missing functions.
- `odd` and `even` took a single number as an argument and returned a boolean to say if the number is odd/even or not.
- The other functions took two numbers as arguments and returned the result of the appropriate operation, eg. `sum` takes two numbers and returns their sum
- `sum` is already defined as an example
- Named, anonymous or arrow functions

In `calculator.test.js`:

- Completed the missing tests for `sum`. Deleted `.skip` from the definitions in order to let them run.
- Wrote tests for the other functions defined. Used **at least two** tests for each function.
